Supplies do not count as units for maintenance counts.<br> Supplies move 1 but receive +1 movement and blitz capability from factories and Halftracks. <br><br>  <b>GAMEPLAY NOTES</b><br> Carriers give defense+1 and range+2 to 2 fleet_fighters in the same zone.<br> Aircraft cannot be placed on new carriers or produced on carriers.<br> Naval bombardment ships support one landing unit for each combat attack dice they use.<br> Bombardment casualties are unable to return fire.<br> All armour unit types are 2 ATT, 1 DEF in Burma and Shan State due to 'T' terrain.<br> All PU valued lands and seas are blockade zones.<br> Harbours may only be placed adjacent to Naval Base territories.<br> For strategic raids, bombers do D2 PUs damage for each attack dice they use in combat.<br> United States connects to Sea Zone 2 via Panama Canal(off map)<br><br>  <b>BATTLECRUISER YAMATO</b><br> This special non-producible unit gives +1 defense to one battleship, carrier, destroyer and cruiser.<br> The Yamato has 2 hitpoints and gives +1 attack to one fighter, one armament and +1 attack/defense to Musashi. <br> Produces three d6 aa 'first-strike' defensive shots versus enemy fighters and fleet_fighters. <br> statistics: attack=3 defense=2 movement=3 bombard=3 carries 1 infantry and 1 fighter. Auto-repairs.<br><br>  <b>BATTLECRUISER MUSASHI</b><br> Sister-ship to the Yamato. Gives +1 attack to one battleship, carrier, destroyer and cruiser. <br> The Musashi has 2 hitpoints and gives +1 defense to one fighter, one armament and +1 attack/defense to Yamato. <br> Produces three d6 aa 'first-strike' defensive shots versus enemy submarines. <br> statistics: attack=3 defense=2 movement=3 bombard=3 carries 1 infantry and 1 fighter.

One-of-a-kind submarine unit received by Japan when Submarine Upgrade is researched. Unit has -1 att/def if any  owned transports are present. Midget gives +1 attack/defense to all other submarine units.<br><br>  <b>SUBMARINE WARFARE</b><br> Japanese placement, movement, and attacks are limited to three submarines per sea zone.<br><br>  <b>ARMAMENTS</b><br> Receives +1 attack fom Cruisers, battleshipX, Dreadnaught, MegaCarrier, SuperSub, and Yamato.<br> Receives +1 defense from battleship, destroyerX, carrierX, Harbour, HarbourX, aaGun, aaGunX  and Musashi.<br> Receives +2 defense from Cruisers, battleshipX, Dreadnaught, MegaCarrier, SuperSub, and Island BunkerX .<br> Armaments represent multi-functional advanced armor and rocket attachments useful alone or as naval upgrades.<br><br>  <b>AI BUG RULE</b><br> (player enforced) 'IF' Americans or Allies ever exceed 200 PUs on Japans turn,  Human player should enter edit mode and do the following: set that AI faction's PUs to 25 and  add one of each possible unit not already at the location to its capital and adjacent sea zone.<br><br>  <b>TECHNOLOGY</b><br> Japan starts the game with six air/naval base territories. Tek resources are produced by each Airbase and  Navalbase map symbol, complexes, and Investment improvements.  Eight is automatically subtracted from the total  Tek Japan receives each turn.  This amount cancels the production from Japans starting bases, leaving them only  one extra Tek produced each turn by their complex.  Japan, the High_Tech unit, and the Panama Sea Zone each  generate one Advanced resource per turn.  When ten base territories are controlled and five technologies  have been researched , a High_Tech unit appears on Japan. Another High_Tech unit will appear if every technology  has been researched.  Research is available after the first round and the cost per token equals 25 PUs, -1 PU per  air/naval base territory controlled, -2 PUs with Research Focus.<br><br>  <b>ENEMY TECHNOLOGY</b><br> Enemy technology is identical to Japanese except for the following:<br>  Spy Network subracts 4 PUs from Japanese income. If Americans and Allies gain Research Focus, they share technology.  SubmarineUpgrade gives a 1:6 chance to place a submarineX each turn. aaGunUpgrade gives 1 aaGunX per originally owned,  currently controlled Air Base territory.  marine is gained from Marine Upgrade or from Paratroopers. marineX is gained  from having both technologies.  halftrack is gained from Marine Upgrade or from Mechanized Infantry.  halftrackX is  gained from having both technologies. Industrial Might adds an extra complex to United States and New South Wales, adds  an Island Bunker to New Britain and Hawaiian, replaces any origninally lost harbours and factories, converts factories  into factoryX, and adds a Harbour to Papua and Philippines. China cannot research technologies.  MarineX unit only costs enemies 3 PUs each.  halftrack/halftrackX unit does not repair at factories but gives infantry types +1 movement.  Enemies of Japan gain one bonus Level Bomber each time they develop a technology. <br><br>       <table border="1"bgcolor="757780"> <br> <th style="font-size:120%;000000"bgcolor="757780"colspan="2">ADVANCED UNITS</th> </tr><tr>  <th bgcolor="757780">UNIT    </th> <th bgcolor="757780">SPECIAL ABILITIES - RESTRICTIONS   </th></tr>  <th bgcolor="a8a8a8">Marine  </th> <th bgcolor="f4f3dd"> +1 amphibious att, +1 att/def on islands, low transport cost, air transportable, receives artillery bonus.   </th></tr>  <th bgcolor="a8a8a8">Halftrack  </th> <th bgcolor="f4f3dd">repairs at complexes.  transports 1 infantry unit. gives +1 att artillery support. +1 amphibous att bonus.

Any aircraft  with scrambling capability, on a ship or with an aaGun, can scramble  to assist on defense if they are within range. The scrambling prompt window  asks if you want to scramble FROM a location TO a location.  Since each  air unit can only scramble one place on each enemy round, consider before  sending.  Many times it is not adviseable to scramble.  Other times  scrambling can produce tremendous results. Experiment and learn.<br><br>
